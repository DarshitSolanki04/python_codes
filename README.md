# python_codes

Basic python codes for beginner problems. Feel free to use.
Rightnow the codes are not efficient and reader friendly as I wrote them while self-learning Python. But I will keep on updating them and adding necessary comments inside the code so that they will make more sense.

Feel free to contribute or update the codes too.
