# python_codes

Basic python codes for beginner problems. Feel free to use.
Rightnow the codes are not well documented and reader friendly as I wrote them while self-learning Python. But I will keep on updating them and adding necessary comments inside the code so that they can make more sense and are easy to understand.

Feel free to contribute or update the codes.
