# python_codes

Basic python codes for beginner problems. Feel free to use them.
Right now, the codes are not well documented and reader-friendly as I wrote them while self-learning Python. But I will keep on updating them and adding necessary comments inside the code so that they can make more sense and are easy to understand.

Feel free to contribute or update the codes.

## Before updating the codes, please keep the following points in mind:
  * Follow PEP 8 convention wherever necessary.
  * Do not mention obvious things/comments.
  * Try to keep the comments/explanations as simple as possible.
  * After editing/updating the codes, run the codes once before creating a pull request.
